## 7. Information Modeling Approaches
### 7.1 Introduction

An understanding of information flows and processing functions is essential for any decision-modeling effort.
Traditionally, these information flows are described in terms that are specific to particular decision
modeling techniques. However, in the heterogeneous supply chain environment, that results in largely
diverse and often incompatible data definitions.
Therefore, a more unified approach to representing information flows and their processing functions is required.
Information modeling techniques long-used for information systems development are well-suited
for these purposes. Supply chain management is an area where interactions
between Decision Sciences and Information Systems Engineering are most
profound.

Implementation of decisions is not possible without information
systems support, and information systems alone without decision-making
components are no longer sufficient to maintain a competitive advantage.
Information modeling is a key part of the information systems modeling
process, where models undergo different phases of elaboration starting
with general requirements for information systems down to semi-executable models directly used in the
implementation phase. The main purpose of these models is to simplify development and maintenance
complexity of large information systems by describing the system using less abstract concepts.
That is especially important for channeling user requirements to system developers.
Similarly, information modeling can be used to describe complex decision-modeling problems.
Besides the descriptive capabilities of information modeling techniques helping to understand the problem,
developed information models provide a link between decision-modeling and the enterprise-wide
information system.

The objective of this chapter is to describe the application of information modeling techniques
for supply chain configuration purposes. The general approach is to use well-approbated information
modeling techniques that would enable potential model-driven implementation of decision-modeling components.
The following section describes the types of information modeling techniques suitable for supply chain
configuration and their application areas.
Process modeling, as applied in the supply chain management and particularly for dealing with the
configuration problem, is discussed in Section 7.3.
**Data modeling is described in Section 7.4. Based on data modeling described and the literature survey
presented in Chapter 3, a generic supply chain configuration data model is developed in Section 7.5.**
Section 7.6 offers summary and conclusions for the chapter.

### 7.2 Information Modeling for Supply Chain Configuration

Information modeling finds multiple applications in supply chain modeling
and different modeling techniques can be used. This section introduces
these applications and lists main modeling techniques available.

#### 7.2.1 Purpose
One of the main objectives of using information modeling is providing a
relatively easily understandable representation of a problem.
Several information modeling techniques are usually applied to obtain a comprehensive representation of the problem.
The choice of techniques and modeling concepts depends upon objectives of the information modeling application.
In the framework of supply chain configuration, several objectives can be identified:
* General description of the modeling problem. Information modeling methods are used to attain a better
understanding of a particular decision modeling problem. They can be especially useful for describing the
decision-making environment. This approach is being used in relation to simulation modeling while it is
rarely considered in relation to analytical modeling.
* Implementation of decision-making components. If decision making is
to be performed routinely, a software application needs to be developed.
Information modeling is an essential part of almost any software development project.
* Definition of links between decision-modeling and other parts of the enterprise-wide information system.
Decision-making models rely on data provided from other parts of the information system and can also use
some functions provided by the supply chain information system. In-
